Slipix is a unique new puzzle game where you touch and drag different layers of an image until the real picture is revealed. These are not jigsaw puzzles. Each layer is a different design or pattern that create unique challenges.

There are 40 unique levels to master with four difficulty levels. Quick Play mode can generate an endless amount of levels to satisfy any puzzle solver. There is even a head to head multiplayer mode (iPad only) so you can play with your friends.
